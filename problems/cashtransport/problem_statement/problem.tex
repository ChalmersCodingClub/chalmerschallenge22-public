\problemname{Cash Transport}
\noindent
CSN just sent you this month's student loan. Finally, you have enough money to
rent DBus, the computer science student division's very own van! You've thought
about going on a road trip but as the responsible student you are you've decided
to use this possibility to earn money. And is there a better strat in the
capitalist grind than robbing armored cash transports?

There are $N$ banks. Bank $i$ has a balance of $a_i$ on day $0$. During the
following $M$ days there will be a cash transport every day. A cash transport
goes from bank $a$ to bank $b$ and takes all of the money in bank $a$ and gives
it to bank $b$. During your time with DBus you will have time to rob $K$ cash
transports (not necessarily consecutively). How much money can you rob at most?

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains three integers $N$, $M$ and $K$ ($1 \le N \le 3
\cdot 10^5$, $1 \le M \le 3 \cdot 10^5$ and $1 \le K \le M$).

\noindent The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_0, a_1, \ldots,
a_N$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^9$), denoting the initial balance of bank $i$.

\noindent The following $M$ lines contains integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \le a, b <
N$, $a \neq b$).  Each pair describes a cash transport between banks $a$ and
$b$.

\section*{Output}

Output a single integer: the maximum amount you can steal from the cash
transports.
