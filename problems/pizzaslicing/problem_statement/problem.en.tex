\problemname{Pizza slicing}
\noindent
Tonight you will be at one of the regular \href{https://au.se/gauss/}{GAUSS} sky observation
nights, and as always there's free pizza.  The $N$ participants have ordered a single giant $A\times
B$ rectangular pizza that you will have to share between you. To break the monotony of looking at
differently sized spherical objects all evening, you have all decided to only eat identically sized
square pieces of pizza. All the participants are hungry, so they will all need at least one slice
each. Additionally, it would be an awful shame to have pizza left over, so all of it must be used
for the identical squares. You brought your very dearly held pizza slicer, and because it is so
precious to you you would like to carry out as few straight slicing cuts as possible. You can move
the pieces of pizza around on your very large table holding your very large pizza, so that multiple
pieces can be sliced in the same cut.

\section*{Input}

The input contains a single line: $N$ ($2 \le N \le 10^{18}$), $A$ and $B$ ($1 \le A, B \le 10^{18}$)
separated by spaces.

\section*{Output}

Print a single number, the least number of cuts required to split the pizza into at least $N$
identically sized square pieces.
